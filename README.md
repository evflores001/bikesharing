## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to find trends in Citi bikes usage using a raw dataset from Citi Bikes website. The dataset consisted of user type, duration, gender, and other features. Using the dataset, visuals were created using Tableau public demonstrating different trends in bike usage for the month of August in NYC. For the purposed of this analysis, the dataset that was downloaded had its timeduration column altered to be in a datetime format.

## Results:

Using the updated csv file, the following tables were created (these can be found in the [images](https://github.com/evflores001/bikesharing/blob/main/images/) folder):

* Checkout Times for Users:
- This graph demonstrated that the most frequent time duration was between 5 and 6 hours.
  
* Checkout Times by Gender:
- This graph though similar to previous, highlights the number of users riding 5-6 hours are predominantly males.

* Trips by Weekday per Hour:
- This graph highlights which days and hours per week are the busiest in bike usage. The day with the highest usage is Thursday between 5pm and 6pm.

* Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour:
- This is similar to the previous graph, however this distinguishes bike usage per weekday per hour by gender.

* User Trips by Gender by Weekday:
- This graph represents the user trips of subscribed and short-term customers by gender per weekday. This highlights that the majority of male subscribers are daily users of CitiBikes.

## Summary:

The results from these graphs are clear and easy to understand. Subscribed user tend to make up the bigger portion of users; moreover, male subcribed user make up a larger portion of overall users. The busiest times of bike usage are between 5pm and 6pm, a typicall time for employees to leave work. Though Thursday was the busiest day of the week in August 2019, the following days leading up and including the weekend saw a steady usage throughout the day.
